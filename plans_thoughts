Admin dashboard:
- layout first design(following a strict structure given), so we use grid


focus on sidebar inner layout first.
eating up space. 
focus on non-dynamic
want them to clump up together and not occupy extra space.
try px with fixed sizes first
so need to reduce the size of the grids.
too much free space to deal with. need some sort of spreading out. 
lets go with the dynamic layout as it seems more reasonable. 
ul also has to be a grid.
keeping gap fixed isn't that bad, we can change it to dynamic when needed.

side bar dummy finished

now focus on the search bar
at first glance there's 2 grid elements. 
but the tough part is deciding appropriate class names.
so the right element won't connect because we gave it fr. 
want to use content layout. 
we need dynamic here?
we might need two columns but 
right, auto and fr 
problem: The name should match the button last thing. 
go with fixed layout and use grip as much as possible. 
to do: roughly fill in the projects with boxes first, then add icons
